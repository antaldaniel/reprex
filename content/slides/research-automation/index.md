## Research Automation

We believe that if you have already done the same data processing or controlling step twice in your team, the problem will show up the third and the fourth time, too.

- If your junior researchers have downloaded the same dataset at least twice, or made the same processing steps in Excel or Power BI already twice, then it is high-time to automate the process, because each manual process is time-consuming and error-prone. 

- For your senior researchers, automation of data validation and unit-testing can save equally many hours.

## Fragments

Make content appear incrementally



{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}
{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}

<Press `Space` to play!>

---

A fragment can accept two optional parameters:

- `class`: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS)
- `weight`: sets the order in which a fragment appears

```markdown
{{%/* speaker_note */%}}
