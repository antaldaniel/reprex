1. Lithuanian creators, including music creators, should earn as much as the European average. Their income should level up to German and Finnish levels.

2. Lithuanian people should find good Lithuanian music in Lithuania on Spotify, YouTube and the radio. Foreign labels must not increase their market share and colonize the local creative ecosystem.

---

# Joining the European Union

- Why should creators earn less than other skilled occupations and knowledge workers?
- Why should artists get less paid than the average in Lithuania?
- Why should Lithuanians get paid less than the average European?

## Why They Recommend American Music

- Is the algorithm cheating? ➡️ trustworthy AI policy, enabling courts, competition and consuerm protection agencies to protect the Lithuanian CCIs
- Is the algorithm learning from bad data? ➡️  national heritage policy, consolidate Lithuanian CCI data as linked, open data, and synch it daily with the world.
- Can we ask for 20% Lithuanian music in radio, television, YouTube or Spotify?

## Lithuania is no different

There are initiatives in the progress: [LATGA](https://www.latga.lt/) already improved the rights management for one part of the composer's rights management, [MIC](https://www.mic.lt/en/about-us/#3) has more than 400 profiles in their database online, [LMVA](https://musicassociation.lt/) already lobbied for quotas, the [Kūrybiškos Europos biuras](https://www.facebook.com/kurybiskoseuroposbiuras/) has bright funding ideas, and the country has a respected national library.

There are facts and ideas: [Muzikos sritis - Ekspertinio vertinimo ataskaita](https://www.ltkt.lt/admin/ckeditor/fileman/Uploads/SAMS/ATASKAITOS/LKT%20ataskaita%20muzika%20Pakarklyte.pdf) | [ArtTech – galimybės Lietuvos kultūros ir kūrybinių industrijų sektoriui. Rekomendacijos

## Still a lot to do

`Still much to do`: revaluing music requires a cooperation of all rightsholders, making sure that the AI systems of streaming services work well requires linking (elements of) the existing databases, probably via the library, to `web of data` to sync knowledge into the global global databases about Lithuania. Plenty of education needed how to revalue, claim money or defend the country from dark algorithms.

## Data biases

- The data about the Lithuanian national cultural output and heritage shoulld be availabe in Lithuania
- Should be daily synchronized with the world via the Europena, Dbpedia, MusicBrainz and other open linked data solutions that connect YouTube, Spotify, and other platforms to daily, up-to-date knowledge to train their algorithms.
- AI is machine learning


---

## Listen Local Lithuania

- `open linked data`: We aim to sync with [AGATA](https://www.agata.lt/),  [LATGA](https://www.latga.lt/), the [Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania](https://www.lnb.lt/), [MIC](https://www.mic.lt/en/) and internationally via the [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/en), [Music Brainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) and  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/music_observatory/?page=1&size=20) with global libraries, music services, and scientic repositories.

- `open and smart policies`: In sync with the the Cultural Ministry of Lithuania, providing a blueprint for film, television, books, newspapers, fashion, architecture, design and other cultural and creative industries.
