OpenCollections is a new collaborative platform developed by Reprex.  Until now, we have been helping with the collection, processing, linking and collective use of open data.  We are now extending our services to book, still images, sound and video recordings. We extend open data with open culture and open science, and the management of open data to open knowledge management.
