Reprex is a Netherlands-based AI and automation company.  
We deliver **measurable business value** in back-office operations, CAPEX planning, research automation, and market analysis—always aligned with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.  

{{< icon name="hand-point-right" pack="fas" >}} We achieve this with a trusted data and AI stack:  
- **Data curation & integration** — combining scattered public and private sources  
- **Validation & annotation** — cleaning and enriching data for reliability, usable across both legacy and new systems  
- **Knowledge graphs** — connecting databases across legal and organisational boundaries  
- **Data sharing spaces** — hubs where databases interoperate and share data *as-needed, as-permitted*  
- **Guardrails for AI** — keeping AI outputs explainable, transparent, and under human oversight  

Together, these capabilities let organisations **scale smarter with data they can trust**.

Growing out of the **Yes!Delft incubator** and recognised with several **innovation awards**, we now work internationally while advancing the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.
