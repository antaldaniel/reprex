Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. To overcome these challenges, the European Union created the [European Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en) strategic plan. It aims to make the EU's economy sustainable by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities, and making the transition just and inclusive for all.

Our automated observatory want to support evidence-based policy making, and KPIs for business and policy-makers alike with truly usable open science and open governmental data. We want to make sure that environmental, socio-economic, political data is brought to easy-to-import, easy to compare, tidy formats.  We use data that has been scientifically validated, and we aim to validate all our open-source processing code in scientific peer-review. 

Our [collaboration is open](/#contributors) for individuals, citizens scientists, research institutes, NGOS, companies.
