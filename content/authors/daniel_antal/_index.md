Founder of Reprex, a company dedicated to building trustworthy data and AI.

Daniel has been writing code since childhood, learned the early foundations of AI in the last century, and today I advise C-level executives on navigating modern AI challenges. His focus: transforming messy, incomplete, or biased data into a reliable foundationâ€”because without clean data, even the best algorithms fail.

Across Europe, whether on stage at AI conferences, in boardrooms, or at hackathons, I share practical insights on how organizations can create real value with AI.

ðŸ‘‰ If your algorithm doesnâ€™t have clean data, [Reprex](https://reprex.nl/) can fix itâ€”or find the right data for you.

He is also a research affiliate at the [Centre for Competition Policy](https://www.linkedin.com/school/ccpuea/) and at the [Institute for Information Law](https://www.ivir.nl/employee/antaldaniel/) of the University of Amsterdam.
