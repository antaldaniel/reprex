      content: 'When you need data from the past, it is too late to start 
      collecting it. If you need satellite data, it is unlikely that you
      can have your own sensors in the space. Working with open data is 
      sometimes cheaper than with market vendor data. But most open data is 
      not processed. We made the investment to clean it for you.'

      content: 'Just weeks before the tragic, but sadly predictable Belgian floods
      we connected some open, but unprocessed opinion poll data about the perception of 
      flood risk, hydrological data about the actual risk of flood, and public finance 
      data in the extremely decentralized country.</br>
      </br>
      The data has been there, but it was not in a form that public policymakers,
      insurers of NGOs could have used directly. We are looking for partners to create
      similar use cases with for computational antitrust researchers or practitioners.'
