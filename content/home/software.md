We believe that transparency is the key to the highest data quality. We use only open source software. We open up the critical elements of our software for peer-review.  

- We use open-source software, there is no vendor lock-in.

- Our data products go through many, automated (unit) tests, replacing countless error-prone human validation working hours.

- The critical elements of our code go through external validation and peer-review by computational statisticians and data scientists.
