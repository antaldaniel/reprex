We want to teach the computer to understand small languages, and of course, everyone, who is under-represented in data: womxn, former colonial nations.

## Why vote for us?

We are finalists in The Hague Innovation Awards with a product offering and a message that big data and AI should work for all: ethnic minorities, small nations, small languages, womxn.  We are measuring why certain artists are not getting recommended and paid on global streaming platforms, or why NGOs do not find the right data about fighting greenwashing.  We want to help small businesses, civil society organizations, and NGOs who cannot hire a data engineer and a data scientist to fight data monopolies. Who cannot defend themselves from the dark patterns of greedy algorithms?
