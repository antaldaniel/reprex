Across Europe, music libraries are under pressure: greater expectations for 
digital services, growing metadata burdens, and increasingly fragmented infrastructure. 
At the same time, vital parts of our musical heritageâ€”especially regional or 
minority repertoiresâ€”remain hidden from search, discovery, and policy.

Please meet us at ðŸ‘‰ [IAML2025](/event/2025-07-07-iaml2025/) in Salzburg on 7 or 8th July. Our presentation takes place in the session of 
**Music Libraries of Tomorrow: Reaching out to Wider Audiences** at the 
Mozarteum University E.001 HS Thomas Bernhard room on 7 July 2025, 16:00â€“17:30. 
The day after you can meet us in the Gallery for the poster session.

We initiated the Open Music Europe project, because we believe that in the music 
ecosystem, data centralisation always fails, and a new kind of cooperation 
is neededâ€”one that respects local control while enabling international reuse.

Our Slovak pilot, the [SKCMDb](https://reprex.nl/project/skcmdb/), connects libraries, music centres, rights organisations, 
and platforms through a shared metadata backbone based on open ontologies. 
Built as a national data sharing space, it enables coordinated cataloguing and 
discovery across public and private systemsâ€”from streaming services and 
printed scores to CD loans and digital archives.

You can download our poster in PDF [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15814286)." numbered="false" >}}


But we also know that cultural and music policy is not only national. 
It is often regional, local, or community-based. Thatâ€™s why we follow the principle 
of subsidiarity: letting decisions and innovation happen at the lowest competent
level, close to the collections and communities themselves.

Our [Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space](https://reprex.nl/project/finnougricdataspace/), including the LÄ«vMDb (Livonian Music Database), 
shows how even the smallest communitiesâ€”without formal cultural 
infrastructureâ€”can take part in high-quality metadata production and digital 
discovery. We provide the tools and models to empower local custodians,
in their language, on their terms, and without the need for large institutional support.

Now we invite IAML membersâ€”national libraries, regional centres, municipal collections,
and independent music librariansâ€”to join us in building a federated, 
decentralised European Music Observatory. One that reflects Europeâ€™s diversity. 
One that reduces data curation costs and improves visibility. 
One that connects music libraries with the open data and open science infrastructures 
already transforming other sectors.

Our platform is open-source, built on FAIR principles and the 
European Interoperability Framework. We use tools like Wikibase, Blazegraph, 
Sampo-UI, and Râ€”packaged to work for libraries with limited technical capacity.

If you care about interoperability, cultural equity, and the future of 
library relevance in the streaming eraâ€”this is your moment to get involved.

Letâ€™s ensure music libraries remain vital entry points to Europeâ€™s rich and evolving cultural soundscape.
