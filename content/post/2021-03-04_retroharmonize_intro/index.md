title: What is Retrospective Survey Harmonization?
subtitle: Joining data from several, differently coded SPSS files.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Retrospective survey harmonization allows the comparison of opinion poll data conducted in different countries or time.  In this example we are working with data from surveys that were ex ante harmonized to a certain degree – in our tutorials we are choosing questions that were asked in the same way in many natural languages.  For example, you can compare what percentage of the European people in various countries, provinces and regions thought climate change was a serious world problem back in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.

## Reproducible ex post harmonization of survey microdata

Retrospective survey harmonization allows the comparison of opinion poll
data conducted in different countries or time. In this example we are
working with data from surveys that were ex ante harmonized to a certain
degree – in our tutorials we are choosing questions that were asked in
the same way in many natural languages. For example, you can compare
what percentage of the European people in various countries, provinces
and regions thought climate change was a serious world problem back in
2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.

We developed the
[retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/) R package
to help this process. We have tested the package with about 80
Eurobarometer, 5 Afrobarometer survey files extensively, and a bit with
Arabbarometer files. This allows the comparison of various survey
answers in about 70 countries. This policy-oriented survey programs were
designed to be harmonized to a certain degree, but their ex post
harmonization is still necessary, challenging and errorprone.
Retrospective harmonization includes harmonization of the different
coding used for questions and answer options, post-stratification
weights, and using different file formats.

[Eurobarometer](https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm),
[Afrobaromer](https://www.afrobarometer.org/), [Arab
Barometer](https://www.arabbarometer.org/) and
[Latinobarómetro](https://www.latinobarometro.org/lat.jsp) make survey
files that are harmonized across countries available for research with
various terms. Our
[retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/) is not
affiliated with them, and to run our examples, you must visit their
websites, carefully read their terms, agree to them, and download their
data yourself. What we add as a value is that we help to connect their
files across time (from different years) or across these programs.

The survey programs mentioned above publish their data in the
proprietary SPSS format. This file format can be imported and translated
to R objects with the haven package; however, we needed to re-design
[haven’s](https://haven.tidyverse.org/)
[labelled\_spss](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html)
class to maintain far more metadata, which, in turn, a modification of
the [labelled]() class. The haven package was designed and tested with
data stored in individual SPSS files.

The author of labelled, Joseph Larmarange describes two main approaches
to work with labelled data, such as SPSS’s method to store categorical
data in the [Introduction to
labelled](http://larmarange.github.io/labelled/articles/intro_labelled.html).

{{< figure src="img/larmarange_approaches_to_labelled.png" caption="Two main approaches of labelled data conversion." numbered="true" >}}

Our approach is a further extension of **Approach B**. Survey
harmonization in our case always means the joining data from several
SPSS files, which requires a consistent coding among several data
sources. This means that data cleaning and recoding must take place
before conversion to factors, character or numeric vectors. This is
particularly important with factor data (and their simple character
conversions) and numeric data that occasionally contains labels, for
example, to describe the reason why certain data is missing. Our
tutorial vignette
[labelled\_spss\_survey](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/labelled_spss_survey.html)
gives you more information about this.

In the next series of tutorials, we will deal with an array of problems.
These are not for the faint heart – you need to have a solid
intermediate level of R to follow.

## Tidy, joined survey data

-   The original files identifiers may not be unique, we have to create
    new, truly unique identifiers. Weighting may not be straightforward.
-   Neither the number of observations or the number of variables (which
    represents the survey questions and their translation to coded data)
    is the same. Certain data may be only present in one survey and not
    the other. This means that you will likely to run loops on lists and
    not data.frames, but eventually you must carefully join them.

## Class conversion

-   Similar questions may be imported from a non-native R format, in our
    case, from an SPSS files, in an inconsistent manner. SPSS’s variable
    formats cannot be translated unambiguously to R classes.
    `retroharmonize` introduced a new S3 class system that handles this
    problem, but eventually you will have to choose if you want to see a
    numeric or character coding of each categorical variable.
-   The harmonized surveys, with harmonized variable names and
    harmonized value labels, must be brought to consistent R
    representations (most statistical functions will only work on
    numeric, factor or character data) and carefully joined into a
    single data table for analysis.

## Harmonization of variables and variable labels

-   Same variables may come with dissimilar variable names and variable
    labels. It may be a challenge to match age with age. We need to
    harmonize the names of variables.
-   The harmonized variables may have different labeling. One may call
    refused answers as `declined` and the other `refusal`. On a simple
    choice, climate change may be ‘Climate change’ or
    `Problem: Climate change`. Binary choices may have survey-specific
    coding conventions. Value labels must be harmonized. There are good
    tools to do this in a single file - but we have to work with several
    of them.

## Missing value harmonization

-   There are likely to be various types of `missing values`. Working
    with missing values is probably where most human judgment is needed.
    Why are some answers missing: was the question not asked in some
    questionnaires? Is there a coding error? Did the respondent refuse
    the question, or sad that she did not have an answer?
    `retroharmonize` has a special labeled vector type that retains this
    information from the raw data, if it is present, but you must make
    the judgment yourself – in R, eventually you will either create a
    missing category, or use `NA_character_` or `NA_real_`.

That’s a lot to put on your plate.

It is unlikely that you will be able to work with completely unfamiliar
survey programs if you do not have a strong intermediate level of R. Our
package comes with tutorials for
[Eurobarometer](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/eurobarometer.html),
[Afrobarometer](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/afrobarometer.html)
and our development version already covers Arab Barometer, highlighting
some peculiar issues with these survey programs, that we hope to give a
head start for less experienced R users.
