And if you want to fix these errors, you may find that you are back to the **Data Sisyphus**.

When you build systems in the cloud, or in your local architecture, at one point you will realise that naming things ‚Äî places, people, products ‚Äî or updating their whereabouts is probably the most time-consuming, most expensive, and most error-prone workflow.

In this blogpost, we want to talk about what seems like the easiest part of a location: the name of the city, town, or village.

## Mazirbe Is Missing Again

We recently built a multilingual gazetteer ‚Äî essentially a reconciled database of place names ‚Äî for a tiny stretch of the Livonian coast in Latvia. At first glance, this might seem like a project rooted deeply in the digital humanities.

But here‚Äôs the twist: the very same problems we tackled here are the ones plaguing the music industry, global e-commerce platforms, and enterprise software stacks.

Mazirbe is a small, big place. It definitely exists, and it is the cultural center of a small nation: the Livonians. Yet, when you are looking for clothing, music, or photographs that should come from Mazirbe in a relevant database, you often find nothing. Not even the place.

#### But Mazirbe exists! 
Depending on the record, it might appear as:
-   Mazirbe (Latvian) ‚Ä¢  Irƒì (Livonian) ‚Ä¢ –ú–∞–∑–∏—Ä–±–µ (Russian) ‚Ä¢ Klein-Irben (German) ‚Ä¢ Suur-Irben (Finnish-German hybrid) ‚Ä¢
–ú–∞–∑–∏—Ä–±–µ (Russian) ‚Ä¢  Mazirbƒó (Lithuanian)

This kind of variation isn‚Äôt just a cultural footnote ‚Äî it breaks databases, mismatches search results, and silently corrupts analytics.

If you're in music metadata, this is your **"JAY Z" vs. "Jay-Z" vs. "Shawn Carter"** problem.

If you're in e-commerce, it‚Äôs **‚ÄúRed Crewneck XXL‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúCrewneck, crimson, 2XL‚Äù**.

Same data structure. Same unresolved chaos.

## A Gazetteer That Works Like Real Life

We created a semantic, multilingual, multiscript gazetteer for the Livonian coast. Each place entry includes:

-   All known name variants across time, languages, and scripts

-   Structured links to global authority services (Wikidata, VIAF, GeoNames)

-   Canonical IDs, multilingual labels, and machine-readable formats (RDF, TTL, etc.)

-   Context about administrative boundaries, historical changes, and source provenance


Try us:

<td style="text-align: center;">

</td>

We published it using **Wikibase** ‚Äî the same technology that powers Wikidata. It's not just a spreadsheet; it's a small, dynamic knowledge graph.

And we also put it into **BlazeGraph**, so you can find all these villages ‚Äî and also the music, the clothing, or photographs that come from them.

## So What?

Here‚Äôs why this matters outside the northern shores of Kurzeme, or beyond the borders of Latvia:

-   In global **supply chains**, location names and vendor names drift constantly. While country boundaries are relatively stable, subnational boundary changes ‚Äî counties, parishes, provinces, municipal borders ‚Äî happen **thousands of times per year**, even within Europe.

-  In **streaming metadata**, artists get duplicated, misspelled, or transliterated inconsistently. It‚Äôs not unusual to find **dozens of same-named artists** in a distributor‚Äôs or rights manager‚Äôs roster.

-  In **CRM systems**, customers have multiple entries because of one diacritic. *Irƒì* becomes *Ire* if the user didn‚Äôt have `ƒì` installed.

-  In **museum heritage databases** and **webshops**, items disappear because their place of origin changed names three times since the accession record was created.

Our little example was created to accompany a digital humanities publication, but it's **not just a ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù problem**. It‚Äôs a **cross-sector, multilingual, historical, bureaucratic, data problem**.

And we‚Äôre all living in it.

## Lessons We Took Away

-  Don‚Äôt fight ambiguity. **Model it.**

- Linked data models (RDF, Wikibase) handle aliases and variants with elegance.

- Small, local, curated vocabularies can scale conceptually to global systems.

- Top-down standardization fails in diverse data ecosystems ‚Äî **context wins**.

If your stack includes **messy location names, user-generated labels, non-English content, or legacy records** ‚Äî maybe this can help.

And if you feel like you‚Äôve seen this movie before‚Ä¶ you have.

It‚Äôs **Data Sisyphus** all over again.
