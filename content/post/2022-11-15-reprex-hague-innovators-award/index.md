Reprex won the Audience Prize in The Hague Innovators Challenge - with about as many votes as the 7 other contenters combined. We really wanted to prove that big data can work for small organizations, too.

Congratulations for [WECO](https://www.joinweco.nl/en-gb) for the startup prize, and our partners, [BeeSage](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/post/2022-10-31_beesage/), for the pre-startup price.  You will hear from BeeSage and Reprex more in the near future.
