## What are the benefits of recycling and harmonizing surveys?

`Surveyharmonies` allows you to make more, bolder, and better-supported statements for your argument. Our technology vastly improves the quality and the inferential capacity of your surveys. 

{{< figure src="img/blogposts_2021/difficulty_bills_levels.jpg" caption="Retrospective survey harmonization means that your answers (we surveyed about 1500 music professionals in 2019) can be compared with other respondants (for example, the same questions asked in Eurobarometer from more than 30,000 people.)" numbered="false" >}}


## Who we are asking?

We are asking music professionals in almost 100 artistic, technical or managerial roles.  The way we form the questions make your answers comparable to the worlds largest database of musicians' (anonymous) income and working condition database, and many non-music specific survey programs, such as Eurobarometer or the European Values Survey.

## What are we asking?

We are asking questions that have been asked before.  We created a small demonstration survey to show how we can better understand gender diversity in the music sector.  We will anonymously record your answers, and connect them to the answers of more than 28,000 people who answered these questions earlier.

#### In your opinion, are inequalities between women and men nowadays very widespread, fairly widespread, fairly rare or very rare in the country where you live?

This question was asked in the {{< spoiler text="Eurobarometer 82.4 survey" >}}
Eurobarometer 82.4: The European Parliament, Autonomous Systems, Gender Equality, and Smoking Habits, November-December 2014.
{{< /spoiler >}}
This means that we can [compare](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/36664/datasets/0001/variables/QB2?archive=icpsr) what different occupational groups, men and women, different age groups answered to this question.



#### And within the music business or music non-profit sector of your country?

We are asking _And within the music business or music non-profit sector of your country, are inequalities between women and men nowadays very widespread, fairly widespread, fairly rare, or very rare in the country that you chose (where you live and work?)_  to gain more insight about the potential differences within the music sector and the country where the music professional lives.

Works best if you use this from music professionals and non-music professionals in the same country.

This question was asked in the {{< spoiler text="Eurobarometer 72.2 survey in 2009." >}}
Eurobarometer 72.2: Nuclear Energy, Corruption, Gender Equality, Healthcare, and Civil Protection, September-October 2009.

This means that we can compare what different occupational groups, men and women, different age groups answered to this question. In 2009, 2030 was a long way many years ahead, but not any more. We could ask this question in two different ways again.  We could ask what people think about 2040 to have a similar perspective, or re-ask how they think about 2030 which is only 8 years away by now.
