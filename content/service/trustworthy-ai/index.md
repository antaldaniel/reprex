title: Turstworhty AI
summary: We follow the ethical guidelines set up the by the European Union for trustworthy AI that is transparent, validated, and free of discrimination.  We create ethical recommendation systems or help the validation and assessment of third-party systems to avoid undetected biases. We believe that AI-driven sales bots should comply with competition and consumer protection rules just like the human salesforce.

We follow the [Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai) set up by the European Union for trustworthy AI that is transparent, validated, and free of discrimination.  We create ethical recommendation systems or help the validation and assessment of third-party systems to avoid undetected biases. We believe that AI-driven sales bots should comply with competition and consumer protection rules just like the human salesforce must do.

- `Data integration`:  Our experience that an investment into AI 80% about data processing and validation, and often in large extent about external data acquisition, and only in very small part about actually training algorithms. We help small organizations to pool large enough datasets and low costs to be able to deploy their own AI systems or detect biases that work against them in large corporate systems. See our [Music Observatory](/project/music-observatory/) demo project and our other services to find the relevant, high quality and affordable data to start training algorithms, or test their effect on your business or policies.

- `Ethical recommendation systems`:  We help our clients to power educational, sales, evaluation applications based on ethical AI that is free of hidden gender, racial, ethnic, and other prohibited biases. See our [Listen Local](/project/listen-local/) demo project.

- `Validation`: We help our clients to understand what illegal biases may affect their sales and promotion processes by using black-box, third party algorithms on various social media, streaming and sales platforms.
