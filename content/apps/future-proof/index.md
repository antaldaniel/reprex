A future-proof IT system, supported by reparative and curative AI or a federated data sharing space, goes beyond storing clean data. It also preserves the methods to repair corrupted records, modernise obsolete outputs, and reshape data for new systems, while staying compatible with legacy software.

Such a system is both future-ready—able to adapt to new technologies—and past-proof, extending the useful life of existing software and infrastructure.

An iconic metaphor for this principle is the Ise Grand Shrine in Japan, which has stood for 1,600 years not because its wooden structures never decayed, but because the knowledge of renewal was embedded in its design and passed on through generations. Likewise, regenerative digital systems preserve not just the data, but the know-how to keep it alive, relevant, and resilient.
