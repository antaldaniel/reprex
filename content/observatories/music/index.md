**The Open Music Observatory (OMO) makes Europe’s music economy more transparent, equitable, and data-driven.**  
It connects fragmented sources of metadata, copyright, and economic indicators to help creators, small labels, policymakers, and researchers.  

Built on the principles of **trustworthy AI and open collaboration**, the OMO improves the quality and interoperability of music data, enabling fairer royalty distribution, better policy insights, and new innovation opportunities across Europe’s music ecosystem.
