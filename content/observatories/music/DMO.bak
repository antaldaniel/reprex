The [Digital Music Observatory](project/music-observatory/)  is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that links public datasets in order to provide a comprehensive view of the European music industry. The DMO produces key business and policy indicators that enable the growth of music business strategies and national music policies in a way that works both for music lover audiences and the creative enterprises of the sector, and contributes to a more competitive, fair and sustainable European music ecosystem.

Its data pillars are following the structure laid out in the [Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/). 

**The Demo Music Observatory Pillars**: 

1. [Music Economy](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html)
2. [Diversity & Circulation](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-diversity.html)
3. [Music & Society](https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-society.html)
4. [Innovation - innovative data applications](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#projects)

Music is one of the most data-driven service industries where the majority of sales are already made by AI-driven autonomous systems.  The DMO is a fully-functional service that can function as a testing ground of the `European Data Strategy`, showcasing the ways in which the music industry is affected by the problems that the `Digital Services Act` and the `Trustworthy AI` initiatives attempt to regulate. If these policies will work for the European microenterprise-dominated, complex and fragile European music ecosystem, then they are likely to make Europe fit for the digital age.

Our Product/Market Fit was validated in the world's 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). We are currently developing this project with the help of the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/) program.

## Use Cases

-	We work with collective management organizations, when they do not have the data, or do not have the right to use the data that they have for various professional uses, including private copying damage claims, setting royalty tariffs (and defending them in copyright or competition tribunals.)

-	We support researchers at universities and consultancy to produce better evidence-based policies, business strategies or scientific output. We provide them thoroughly tested, properly processed, ready-to-import, ready-to-use data in various music, creative industries, competition, and climate change related issues. We work with very heterogeneous and highly fragmented data.

-	Our team members have been involved with open governmental and open science data for almost 20 years individually. We know how to find, process, and make usable legally open, unique data which cannot be purchased on the market (from university archives, tax authorities, public satellites) in a way that matches scientific or financial auditing standards.

-	We participate in various trustworthy, ethical AI R&D projects with high-quality data and testing data to perform bad outcomes or malfunctioning recommendations of music AI systems.
