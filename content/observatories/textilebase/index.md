**TextileBase connects dispersed knowledge about textiles and dress history into a multilingual, interoperable knowledge graph.**  
It links artefacts, photographs, museum records, and secondary sources, making fragile and fragmented evidence of clothing more usable for research, cultural heritage, and sustainable fashion.  

Designed for **museums, researchers, and businesses**, TextileBase supports FAIR/8-star data publishing, provenance tracking, and digital product passportsâ€”turning scattered fragments into a **living map of dress history**.
