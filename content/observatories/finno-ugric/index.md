**The Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space (DSS) helps communities, museums, and libraries bring scattered cultural records back together.**  
It connects garments, songs, photographs, and documents that are often stored in different countries, languages, or institutional systems, creating a shared platform for preservation and discovery.  

Unlike a centralised archive, the DSS follows a **federated model**: collections remain with their custodians, but can be linked, annotated, and enriched collaboratively. This makes it possible to respect local knowledge, legal frameworks, and cultural sensitivities while still building a **multilingual, interoperable network of heritage data**.  

The DSS is also our **prototype for solving very difficult data problems**. It deals with scattered sources, multiple languages (including non-standardised ones), and a mix of private and public data. These challenges mirror business realities: companies also work across borders, industries, and stakeholder groups — from corporate and financial partners to social and environmental actors — all using different systems, formats, and languages. By stress-testing our methods in this demanding cultural context, we develop tools and practices that are directly applicable to **complex business data spaces**.  

The DSS is designed for **NGOs, regional museums, archives, libraries, and community groups** who want to:  
- make their collections more visible,  
- connect with related materials across borders,  
- and support **language preservation, cultural storytelling, and digital exhibitions**.
