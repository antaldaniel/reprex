Daniel Antal introduced on the part 2 of Data Week 2024 and LAILEC the Open Music Observatory, the subjective take of the Open Music Europe consortium on creating a European data observatory with the help of a modern, federated, decentralised data-sharing space that is interoperable with various EU digital services. The short presentation was held in the plenary session (16.00-18.00.)

At 14.00, in the [Data-driven automated compliance session](https://data-week.eu/session/data-driven-and-automated-compliance/
) (Room Erasmus 3), Daniel spoke about the Sustainability and Innovation pillars of the music observatory in light of the complex compliance issues raised by the CSRD Directive and the difficult-to-access but favourable green financing and insurance opportunities open for the music, film, and another creative sector.
