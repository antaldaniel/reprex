Join us on **12 September 2025** at the **House of Hungarian Music, Budapest** for a hands-on workshop on how **small labels, music libraries, and private collectors** can connect their catalogues and archives to the new **Open Music Europe / OpenMusE data sharing space**.

We will show how the **Slovak and Hungarian music data spaces** ‚Äî federated through the **Open Music Observatory** ‚Äî make it easier to:

- Share and repair metadata across archives, libraries, labels, and streaming platforms  
- Use identifiers (ISRC, ISWC, VIAF, etc.) to improve visibility and royalty distribution  
- Manage voluntary deposits and digital surrogates for private collections  
- Connect local catalogues to international platforms like **Spotify, YouTube, Wikidata, MusicBrainz**  

## Who should attend?
- **Independent and small labels** seeking better visibility in digital distribution  
- **Music libraries and archives** aiming for cross-platform metadata integration  
- **Private collectors** interested in digitising and sharing their holdings responsibly  

## Why attend?
- Learn how open-source tools like **Wikibase** make metadata sharing affordable and sustainable  
- Discover how services such as **Unlabel** help bring hidden catalogues into global circulation  
- Network with peers from Hungary, Slovakia, and beyond who face similar challenges
