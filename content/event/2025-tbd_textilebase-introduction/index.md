{{% callout note %}} 
The time shown on the page is preliminary, we are reaching out to our colleagues and friends to find a suitable date. 
{{% /callout %}}

We would like to have a light, summer seminar/webinar with our colleagues, friends and interested stakeholders on TextileBase.

We would like to introduce in very short, live demonstrations with clickable links what we do. üëâüèæ [`TextileBase` project page](https://reprex.nl/project/textilebase/)

## Topics For Discussion
{{% callout note %}} 
1. What is TextileBase? How can it connect knowledge and data across musuems, archives, libraries, repositories, Europeana, ECCCH, Wikidata?

2. Technical features: Wikibase Suite for manual editing. SPARQL endpoint. Sampo-UI for researcher comfort.

3. Use case: The Latgalean dataset took years to create. We already have a Seto and Livonian dataset in weeks. 

4. Using AI & Computational Linguistics for automated research, data enrichment and novel insights.

5. The WikiMuseum concept: co-curating international virtual exhibitions with dispersed collections.

Each block is expected to last 10-12 minutes, with immediate questions, followed by a hybrid coffee, meet & drinks.

### SPARQL Endpoint
We will place here a few sampe querries:

### Sampo UI

We are going to unveil a similar interactive website on the webinar to the [OperaSampo](https://oopperasampo.fi/en/); `TextileBase` will run on Sampo, following [dozens of successful](https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/tools/sampo-ui/) digital humanities projects.
