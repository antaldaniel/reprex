summary: "Our presentation shows how Wikimedia tools and federated dataspace design can reconnect dispersed heritage of small communities, such as the Livonians, VÃµros, Setos, and Maris. We introduce the Wikimuseum exhibition model and the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space (FUDSS), both designed to combine encyclopedic, archival, museum, and private collections into multilingual, interoperable cultural knowledge graphs."

14:30â€“15:00 Our [presentation](/slides/20250928-wikimuseum-ceem2025/) took place in the session  
**GLAM Cooperation and Community Exhibitions** at Wikimedia CEE Meeting 2025 in Thessaloniki.

We invite Wikimedia communities, GLAM partners, and digital humanists to join us in building a multilingual, interoperable Wikimuseum and extending the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space.\

Our talk introduced the **Wikimuseum** concept: collaborative, multilingual exhibitions that bring together museum objects, archival documents, photographs, and private collections into Wikimedia-powered virtual showcases. As a case study, we presented the **Livonian garment exhibition**, where dispersed artefacts from Finland, Estonia, and Latvia were digitally reunited for the first time in a century.

We also showed how this approach interlinks with the **Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space (FUDSS)**, a federated Wikibase-driven dataspace designed for small, endangered, or diasporic heritage communities. The DSS applies the **European Interoperability Framework** to cultural data, connecting CIDOC-CRM museum records, DCTERMS library metadata, and Wikibase lexemes, while respecting local epistemologies and multilingual vocabularies.

### Highlights
- How joint Wikimedia exhibitions allow GLAM institutions and citizen scientists to co-curate without moving artefacts physically.  
- How multilingual Wikibase lexemes and semantic interoperability support endangered languages like Livonian, VÃµro, and Mari.  
- How a Wikibase Suite and Lexeme can provide for an alternative incubator for small communities with modern AI support.

### Next steps
- Extend the Livonian and Seto exhibitions with more garments, and photographs. 
- Extend our music collections and publish ethnomusicologically relevant datasets.
- Align the Wikimuseum model with the ECCCH Heritage Digital Twin Ontology.
