Most music is being recommended by algorithms, not only to subscribers of YouTube or Spotify but also to radio editors, concert promoters and festival organisers. This led to the conclusion that rights management organisations (CMOs) and music information centres (MICs) must improve their practices to remain competitive and visible. Using modern data-enriching techniques, we ensure that they have the most accurate 360Â° views of the repertoire they represent. We also guarantee that digital streaming services and search engines are informed about precise and up-to-date knowledge. 

See our presentation made in the IAMIC 2024 conference in Vienna:

- [x] We want to ensure that a MICs and CMOs have the most accurate information about music. Whenever data is missing or new information has yet to reach their database, we try to look up the data from reliable sources and ensure that it arrives automatically in their system (to be reviewed by a knowledgeable human curator).

- [x]  Make all music in Slovakia visible on all global music systems, encyclopaedia, Europeana and the European Cultural Heritage Cloud. Enable people to locate sheets of works for sale or public lending and show where people can listen to the music in various formats.

- [x]  Provide the information in a dual format: enable a MIC to provide machine-readable, standardised, RDF annotated data to directly support the recommender systems of Spotify, YouTube, Deezer and other platforms.

- [x]  Provide CMOs with a framework to make their members more visible to digital streaming platforms by enrichment, control and processing of available metadata and to also inform radio stations about the potential recordings that count into their local content, thus promoting local CMO members.
