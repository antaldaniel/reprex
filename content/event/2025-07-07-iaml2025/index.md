16:00â€“17:30 Our [presentation](/slides/20250707-reprex-iaml2025/) takes place in the session of 
**Music Libraries of Tomorrow: Reaching out to Wider Audiences** at the 
Mozarteum University E.001 HS Thomas Bernhard room.

We want invite IAML membersâ€”national libraries, regional centres, municipal collections,
and independent music librariansâ€”to join us in building a federated, 
decentralised European Music Observatory. ðŸ‘‰ [Help Us Build a Truly Inclusive European Music Observatory (invitation blogpost)](/post/2025-07-05-iaml-2025/)
{{% /callout %}}

Our presentation at **IAML 2025** introduces the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database*
(**SKCMDb**), a national pilot within [Open Music Europe](https://openmuse.eu/). 
It offers a pragmatic, scalable solution to a widespread challenge: aligning 
metadata from libraries, archives, rights organisations, and digital distributors 
without centralisation or heavy infrastructure.

Built on the *European Interoperability Framework*, **SKCMDb** creates a legal, 
semantic, and organisational bridge between institutions like the Slovak Music Centre, 
SOZA, and public libraries, while also integrating with global platforms like 
Wikidata and MusicBrainz. We show how library records, music rights data, and 
streaming metadata can be reused and enriched across systemsâ€”supporting 
discoverability, legal compliance (like local content quotas), and better 
access to Slovak music.

This presentation will be especially valuable for professionals working in 
metadata curation, authority control, and digital service design, and those 
seeking low-cost, high-impact pathways to public-private interoperability 
in cultural heritage.

### Next steps

The Slovak pilot illustrates how libraries and national music centres can take a
central role in a decentralised European Music Observatory that federates with the 
EU Open Data Portal, Europeana, ECCCH, DARIAH, and Zenodo. 
This poster accompanies a companion contribution on the [Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space](https://reprex.nl/project/finnougricdataspace/), 
including the LÄ«vMDb (Livonian Music Database), which explores how smaller 
regional repertoires can be embedded in broader, multimodal cultural 
graphsâ€”advancing the vision of a European Music Observatory as a complement 
to the European Cultural Heritage Cloud.
