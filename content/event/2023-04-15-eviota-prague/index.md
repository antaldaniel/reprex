🇨🇿 [in Czech soon](/event/2023-03-03_eviota_budapest/#czech) 


The aim of the [Eviota for Music](/project/musiceviota/) is to help responsible music businesses, social enterprises, non-profit organisations and civil society organisations in their economic and sustainability management, control and reporting. More and more enterprises will be expected to create a management report (in their audited or, for smaller entities, non-audited) annual report about their impact on the environment, social sustainability and governance to prevent corruption. The new Corporate Social Responsibility Directive entered into force on 5 January 2023 and changed the accounting laws of European countries.  Companies will be expected to reduce their CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions by 55% until 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

- 11:30: Meet and greet
- 11:45: Short presentation 
- 12:00: Discussion of your reporting

*CEST Central European Summer Time*

The discussion will be based on the accounting documents sent to us in advance. We will create a first version of a simplified sustainability report about your music or film company (for profit, or non-profit.) we will not share any financial information in the meetup, only visualizations of risk heatmaps, and common reporting and sustainability problems.

{{< spoiler text="Why connect to your accounting software?" >}}

The accounting system already records all those economic events that may have an impact on how your company, directly or indirectly, causes greenhouse gas emissions, uses precious water, or may help to close (or, accidentally, widen) the gender pay gap. 

As soon as the modification of the EU accounting directive take effect, you will have to connect your financial accounts to your sustainability reporting.

- [x] No extra management time is needed: it is already recorded by every company's accountant. The general ledger is recorded by your accountant. We start from the annual summary of supplier and buyer ledgers, or the trial balance that has this information.
- [x] It is not subjective.  It states exactly what you were spending on.
- [x] It is more or less standardized across Europe—and almost all countries of the world, with the exception of the U.S. and some other countries. It is easy to reconcile with US GAAP based documents.
- [x] We need to use the same working document that your accountant uses to maintain an important objectivity criterion: connectivity. 

This way your annual report will be consistent, if you say in the financial part that you spend 1000 euro on energy, then we will calculate the greenhouse gas emissions based on KWh volume of the the energy that cost you 1000 euros.
