location: "online"

summary: "This presentation explores how the Wikibase Suite can function as a rights-aware data-sharing space connecting Wikimedia projects, community archives, and institutional databases. It shows how dispersed cultural heritage of small Finno-Ugric and Baltic communities can be reconnected through interoperable, multilingual knowledge graphs."

abstract: "Our talk demonstrates how Wikibase can act as a staging area and a federated data hub between Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, and trusted institutional or private databases. We discuss how rights management, provenance tracking, and community governance make it possible to include materials that are not yet fully open or require special permissions. The Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space (FUDSS) and the Wikimuseum exhibition model illustrate how endangered languages and regional collections can be documented, shared, and later federated back to Wikidata and Commons."

{{% callout note %}} 
In our use scenario, Wikibase Suite provides a federated data-sharing space between
Wikimedia projects, Europeana, and other trusted partners.  

From the perspective of 
Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, it serves as a **staging area and alternative incubator** 
for datasets that are still under review, 
have mixed rights status, or originate from specialised community archives.

{{% /callout %}}


### Key Ideas
- **Federation:** connects open and restricted databases while preserving provenance.  
- **Rights management:** allows data to be public domain, under Creative Commons, or shared via local “use policies” such as non-commercial only.  
- **Knowledge stewardship:** supports community-led peer review for small or specialist domains that fall outside general Wikimedia governance.

### Examples
- The [Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space](https://finnougric.net/en/) integrates recordings, images, and linguistic data for Livonian, Võro, Seto, and Mari communities.  
- The [hudobnadatabaza.sk](https://hudobnadatabaza.sk/en/) aims to provide access to all music ever made in Slovakia, weather in print sheets loanable in libraries, webshops in CD or sheet format, or song streaming on Spotify.
- The [Wikimuseum](/event/2025-09-28_wikimedia_ceem/) exhibition model allows GLAM institutions and citizen scientists to co-curate collections without physically moving artefacts.

There is a lot more than CC-BY-SA to opening up open culture for wide audiences." numbered="false" >}}


### Next Steps
- Align our Wikibase Ontology with the [Wikidata:WikiProject Ontology/Cleaning Task Force](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Ontology/Cleaning_Task_Force#Current_and_Past_Participants) to 
provide better mapping of cultural objects, permissions, duties and rights related to their use.
- Improve our exchange mechanism with Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons.
- Design better quality checks for the data.
