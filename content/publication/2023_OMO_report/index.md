abstract: "This early technical report documents the initial architecture and proof-of-concept of the Open Music Observatory (OMO). It was prepared before consortium partners began supplying real-world data and before the system was stress-tested with operational pipelines. While it demonstrates feasibility and design principles, the report should be seen as a preliminary step. A new, data-driven edition will follow in 2025 as the Observatory matures and is validated with live data."

summary: "Early technical report on the Open Music Observatory, documenting design and proof-of-concept prior to full data integration. Updated edition coming soon."

## About this Release

This report presents the **first technical foundations** of the Open Music Observatory.  
It was written before consortium partners supplied their datasets and before **real data pipelines were stress-tested**.  

The document outlines the Observatory’s architecture, data governance approach, and integration strategy, but it remains an **early edition**.

**Note:** This version is preliminary and should not be cited as a final technical reference. A new, data-driven edition will be released in 2025 once the Observatory has been validated with live data from partners.

## Next Steps

The upcoming edition will integrate **real-world metadata, copyright, and economic indicators**, stress-tested through operational pipelines, and will provide a more complete technical baseline for Europe’s music data space.
