abstract: "This article introduces TextileBase, a multilingual knowledge graph that connects dispersed data on garments from museums, archives, and libraries. By transforming artefact records, photographs, and texts into interoperable knowledge statements, it enables interdisciplinary research across dress history, ethnography, and sustainable fashion. The preprint demonstrates early results using Baltic and Finno-Ugric datasets and shows how TextileBase improves searchability, semantic interoperability, and reuse of cultural heritage data."
