# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "This influential article analyses how Europe can strengthen the visibility and accessibility of its cultural and creative works by improving copyright data infrastructures. It highlights the risks of poor metadata, the opportunities of Article 17 of the CDSM Directive, and the importance of trustworthy systems for licensing and remuneration. The music sector, where fragmented metadata leads to lost royalties and unfair competition, provides key examples. The work continues to inform our projects on trustworthy AI, data governance, and cultural data spaces."

abstract_short: "A highly cited article on copyright data and metadata policies, with strong implications for Europeâ€™s music industry and cultural data spaces."

This article, published in *JIPITEC* in 2022, remains one of our most cited works on copyright, metadata, and cultural policy.  

The paper shows how **fragmented copyright metadata** undermines the visibility of European creative works, causes **royalty losses** for artists, and limits the ability of European industries to compete globally in emerging areas like **AI training** and **recommender systems**.  

Using the **music industry** as a central case study, the article highlights why improved metadata and licensing infrastructures are vital. Its findings directly connect to our current projects on **trustworthy AI, cultural data spaces, and fair remuneration systems**.
