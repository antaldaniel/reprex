abstract: The aim of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database (SKCMDb) is to provide a trustworthy description and easy access to all music created on the territory of the modern Slovak Republic or created by musicians who have lived in Slovakia, use the Slovak language or claim Slovak identity. It does not aim to define „Slovakness” in legal or ethnomusicological terms; it wants to make the new music made in the country visible and provide access to its music heritage, including the heritage of its minority communities. The linked databases, supported by a data sharing space, create an unprecedented undertaking that aims for organisational, legal, semantic, and technical interoperability among the data systems of Slovak public institutions and the rights management organisations and enterprises of the private sector. My conference lecture and publication focused on its replicability and the possibility of data federation with Hungarian music data owners.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The Slovak Comprehensive Music Database (SKCMDb) provides a trustworthy, interoperable register of music created in or connected to Slovakia, making national and minority repertoires visible and accessible through linked databases that bridge public institutions and private rights organisations.
