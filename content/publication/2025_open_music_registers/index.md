# Abstract
abstract: "This technical report introduces *Open Music Registers*, a federated, standards-based infrastructure for harmonising music-related registers—covering creators, publishers, performers, works, recordings, and venues—into a semantically interoperable dataspace. Building on the Horizon Europe Open Music Europe project, the report shows how Wikibase, persistent identifiers (ISNI, ISRC, ISWC, OpenCorporates), and European data governance frameworks can reduce duplication, improve metadata quality, and enable reuse across rights management, statistics, cultural policy, and research. Pilot implementations such as the Slovak Music Economy Register and the SKCMDb demonstrate how open, multi-purpose registers can connect public, private, and informal sector data for cultural and economic measurement."

summary: "Technical report on Open Music Registers, demonstrating a federated infrastructure for harmonising music-related registers into an interoperable dataspace."

## About this Release

This technical paper is part of the **Open Music Observatory** under the Horizon Europe *Open Music Europe* project.  
It presents an early framework for federated music registers and demonstrates how they can support **rights management, cultural statistics, and business innovation**.  

The current edition describes the design principles and pilot implementations.  
Future editions will extend the model with more data partners, stress-tested pipelines, and additional use cases.
