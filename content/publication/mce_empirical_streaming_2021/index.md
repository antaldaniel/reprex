# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "This report analysed how UK music creators earn from streaming and why their revenues are often flat or declining despite overall market growth. It showed that without international data harmonisation and advanced survey methods, it is impossible to measure the earnings of a typical rights-holder. The study highlighted exchange rate effects, falling per-stream values, and the limits of current remuneration schemes. It contributed to UK and EU policy debates on equitable remuneration and transparent distribution in the streaming era."

abstract_short: "Empirical study on UK music creatorsâ€™ streaming earnings, commissioned for the Music Creatorsâ€™ Earnings Project."

summary: "Commissioned by the UK IPOâ€™s Music Creatorsâ€™ Earnings Project, this report examined the economics of music streaming and its distributional impact on British creators."

This report was commissioned by the [Music Creatorsâ€™ Earnings Project](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era) to provide an **empirical analysis of music streaming revenues in the UK**.  

It showed that:
- total market growth often hides **flat or declining individual earnings**,  
- **exchange rate effects** played a major role in sustaining incomes during 2015â€“2019,  
- and current **remuneration schemes and pro-rata distribution systems** do not adequately reflect the value of music for most rightsholders.  

The study argued for **international data harmonisation, better survey methods, and policy coordination** to make earnings more transparent and equitable.
