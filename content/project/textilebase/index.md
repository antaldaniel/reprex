{{% callout note %}} The main goal of TextileBase is to help dress history scholars and practitioners by creating a gateway to linked data that have been collected and stored by researchers and memory institutions. In that way it is a platform to collect, connect, and share meta- and research data on material, visual, and textual sources of historical clothing. We explain TextileBase as a linked, open, graph database in a different report. In this review we show how we placed a valuable, stand-alone dataset into this interoperable database. {{% /callout %}}

The first published dataset, [Linked Open Datasets on Garments from the Latgale Region](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=Linked_Open_Datasets_on_Garments_from_the_Latgale_Region "Linked Open Datasets on Garments from the Latgale Region") contains data on Latvian traditional shirts and skirts from the Latgale region in Eastern Latvia. The The [female](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=Item:Q232 "Item:Q232") and [male shirts](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=Item:Q233 "Item:Q233"), and the [skirts](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=Item:Q234 "Item:Q234") in the dataset are handmade and were worn in the 19th century. They represent both festive and daily wear of the local female and male peasants. The shirts are stored at the [National History Museum of Latvia](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=National_History_Museum_of_Latvia "National History Museum of Latvia") and the [Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/index.php?title=Ethnographic_Open-Air_Museum_of_Latvia "Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia"). The data contain information on the locality of their origin, their approximate date of creation with various precisions, the materials they are made of, and the way of their fabrication, as well as their purpose of wearing (festive or daily wear) and wearerâ€™s ethnicity and gender. They also include the name of the museum each shirt is stored at, supplemented with its unique inventory number. Data on some sample shirts also include a photo of the shirt.
