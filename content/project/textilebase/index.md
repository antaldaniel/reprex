{{% callout note %}} The main goal of TextileBase is to help dress history scholars and practitioners by creating a gateway to linked data that have been collected and stored by researchers and memory institutions. In that way it is a platform to collect, connect, and share meta- and research data on material, visual, and textual sources of historical clothing. {{% /callout %}}

## A Semantic Knowledge Graph for Textile and Dress History

**TextileBase** is a knowledge graph that interconnects databases and secondary sources—such as artefact photographs, contemporary images, drawings, and written descriptions—related to textile and dress history. It supports diverse areas of textile research, from historical dress studies to sustainable fashion.

Technically speaking, building an interactive website for textile history is like setting up a webshop—except all the product information is either missing or fragmented. There are no barcodes, producers, or standard descriptions. Instead, the relevant information is buried in academic knowledge, secondary sources, or scattered fragments of primary data.

This is where **AI can significantly assist**: by gathering, linking, and inferring data at a speed and scale beyond human capacity.

**Connecting Surviving Artefacts**

Unlike metal objects or buildings, textiles are fragile and rarely survive intact. They are worn, used, and discarded. Even from the 19th century, very few textiles remain.

Our goal is to create a tool that connects fragmented museum inventories and catalogues across institutions—linking rare textile artefacts in a coherent, searchable network.

**The Challenges of Linked Open Data in Textile History**

While digital humanities frequently refer to “linked open data” or the “Internet of Things,” textile history is still at the early stages of adopting these frameworks. A key goal of TextileBase is to give each artefact—like the **Seto shirt**—a unique URI. But generating URIs for garments in small rural museums or private collections is often time-consuming and expensive.

TextileBase seeks to streamline this process—making it **faster, cheaper, and more reliable.**

{{< figure src="/png/dataspace/textilebase/Leather_shoes_with_fur_front_side_Mõniste_Rural_Life_Museum.jpg" caption="These fury leather shoes are a very rare specimen, and they are on display in the Mõniste Rural Life Museum. They do have a local inventory number, but none of the items of this small and excellent museum is available on Internet of Things. By adding artefact photographs, a DOI or an ISCC identifier, and giving a permanent identifier for this artefact, we can connect it with other leader shoes, other Seto garments that are found in far away collections (TextileBase [Q256](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/Item:Q256)). For example, Aladár Bán collected a somewhat similar shoe in Setomaa in 1911. Finding that artefact in the digital collection of the Hungarian Ethnographic Museum in Budapest under the inventory number [NM97021](https://gyujtemeny.neprajz.hu/neprajz.01.01.php?bm=1&kv=3300296&nks=1) and the rather specialist and bit archaic title „bocskor” is even a challenge for native speakers of that language. It is connected to the other Seto footwear as TextileBase [Q348](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/Item:Q348)." numbered="false" >}}

**The Importance of Secondary Sources**

Historical collecting practices were often biased. Textiles worn by everyday people—peasants, laborers, minority groups—were rarely preserved. Instead, most surviving collections reflect the lives of elites or were gathered during ethnographic expeditions with colonial or exoticizing perspectives.

That’s why **secondary sources**—such as period photographs, illustrations, and books—are so valuable. They often unintentionally document everyday garments, offering insights missed by early collectors.

**Case Study: Finno-Ugric Traditional Clothing**

We focus on the clothing traditions of small Finno-Ugric communities—such as the **Setos** and **Livonians**—due to the technical and linguistic challenges involved.

For example, Livonian communities in present-day Latvia were largely assimilated by the late 19th century. Setos are now found in southeastern Estonia and Russia's Pskov oblast. Their artefacts are scattered across Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian archives, usually documented in those languages—rarely in Livonian, Seto, or even English.

That village is known today as [Miķeļtornis](https://reprexbase.eu/textilebase/Item:Q346) in Latvian (local Livonian spelling: Pizā), Courland is known as Kurzeme, and of course, the country is Latvia." numbered="false" >}}

We must build a **historical namespace** of place names, languages, even spelling history, and garment classifications to search and understand this data. This includes terms like "shirt" in Finnish (paita), Hungarian (ing), or Estonian, and accounts for changing styles, materials, and local terminologies. This is one of the uses of `TextileBase`: it contains knowledge about words, placenames, their morphology, so that researchers not familiar with the collection's language (and its historical changes, abbreviations) can work globally.

**What Business Can Learn from TextileBase**

You may think this is a niche academic project. But the challenges we tackle—**changing place names, multilingual records, incomplete legacy data**—are universal in business.

-   When a company acquires a legacy system, it spends time and money just fixing inconsistent addresses.

-   Global databases face problems when towns merge, streets are renamed, or countries change borders.

-   People change names, too: marriage and divorce often change surnames. Rights are inherited by descendants who may or may not use the same surnames, making long-lived copyright claims particularly difficult to trace.

-   Searching for “a skirt from Venäjä, Kuurinmaa, Pissen” is equivalent to finding a misfiled invoice or product from a renamed supplier.

Our work shows how **semantic technology and AI can solve real-world problems** across industries—by cleaning, organizing, and making sense of historical or fragmented information.

**Building a Wikimuseum for Dispersed Collections**

Inspired by Wikimedia Estonia’s multi-language, open-access model, we propose a **virtual museum**—a **Wikimuseum**—that brings together:

-   Artefacts from rural museums (e.g., Mõniste, Saatse, Värska)

-   Items in national museums (Estonia, Finland, Hungary)

-   Private collections that would never be physically exhibited together

This approach connects dispersed knowledge—across time, languages, and borders—into a shared digital space.

**How AI Supports Textile Research**

TextileBase incorporates **AI-driven tools**—language models, translation engines, inference systems—that can:

-   Search for historical placenames across multilingual archives

-   Identify garments in photos or scanned books

-   Detect and match synonyms or spelling variants

-   Flag potentially relevant images and documents for expert review

By operating within the TextileBase framework, our AI tools remain **human-controlled and explainable**, reducing the risk of hallucinated or misleading results.
