`OpenMusE` brings together music industry stakeholders and researchers from 11 EU countries and Ukraine. Our consortium recognises that placing European music ecosystems on a more competitive, fair, and sustainable footing requires evidence-based policymaking, business planning, and accuracy. 

We provide the data needed for these actions. Using transparent methods and tools, OpenMusE maps the policy and data landscape; bridges data gaps; and empowers stakeholders and policymakers to take data-driven actions. Our project is grounded on principles of open policy analysis, open science, and open-source software development. We work with stakeholders to identify data gaps on the EU, national, and regional levels; co-create indicators and methods for bridging them; develop free software tools for data collection and analysis; and report not just our findings, but every step taken to reach them. 

This is the logic behind our `Open Music Observatory` (OMO, developed from the earlier [CEEMID](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/usecase/ceemid/) and the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) concept), an open-source platform that provides 360-degree intelligence on the music industry by integrating numerous data sources. The OMO is highly automated, providing “living policy documents” that refresh when the backend datasets are updated: these datasets include official statistics on music goods and services; data on musical participation via pan-European surveys, rights-holder data voluntarily shared by industry partners, and streaming service data sampled using novel algorithms developed by our consortium. Using the OMO and our open-source software, music MSMEs without technical departments or expertise will be able to access and analyse open data; model volume and value, including of zero-price uses; create better business models; and generate corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports; all at a fraction of current costs. We validate these tools in four pilot studies that will bring concrete benefits to stakeholders within the project lifespan.

{{% callout note %}} The `Open Music Observatory` is not an alternative to the legal structure of the European Music Observatory. It is an open project that shows how the best practice of open knowledge managements, the use of the Open Data Directive and the Open Policy Analysis framework, with the new instruments of data altruism and the Data Governance Act can help building an observatory that can fulfill most of the purposes of the European Music Observatory---and remain open for global music industry players, too. See our 
planned data correspondence to the planned European Music Observatory pillars at the end of this [document](#data-coverage).

## Open collaboration
Our project is based on open collaboration.  Our proposal, will provide us with resources to supply further music businesses, music civil society organizations and researchers with high-quality data (during the duration of the project for free.)  The open collaboration means that 
- we will ask all representative music organizations to join our advisory board and set priorities so that we can work for the benefit of all the European Music Ecosystem.
- our improved valuation, ESG/SDG reporting, diversity promotion tools will be open for national public organizations and businesses to use; 
- for-profit and non-profit organizations *who are not members of our Consortium* can solve in the form of public use case studies some of their valuation/ESG; reporting/diversity measurement issues provided that they pay for their own project management and translations costs;
- our cases studies intended to improve the economic situation, resilience and diversity problems of organizations in the Consortium can be freely replicated with our online tools, live policy documents, and our `Open Data Observatory`. 

*See existing [business partners](#business-partners), [civil society & social enterprise partners](#cso-partners) and [academic partners](#academic-partners).*

The project’s scoping aim is to create an open, scalable data-to-policy pipeline for European music ecosystems. 
- [x] [MAP](#MAP) the policy and data landscape all over Europe, but with a focus on select countries
- [x] [BRIDGE](#BRIDGE) data gaps with open data that anybody can use
- [x] [EMPOWER](#EMPOWER) stakeholders and policymakers to take data-driven actions	

The objectives are designed to advance the state of the art with regard to data collection, policymaking, and business practices in these three pillars of the music industry. Both the objectives and the outputs will be optimised for transferability to other cultural and creative industries.

## MAP the policy and data landscape all over Europe {#MAP}

*“Develop indicators to better detect the performance of the European music sector and its contribution to economic and social development, as well as to sustainability”*	
1. Develop policy-relevant indicators for the total `economic value of music`
2. Develop policy-relevant indicators for `music diversity and circulation`
3. Develop policy-relevant indicators for the `societal impact` of music ecosystems, within an SDG framework
4. Develop policy-relevant indicators for the `resilience` of music ecosystems, within an `SDG` framework.

*“Provide new/improved methodologies for capturing the economic and societal value of music”*
1. Develop new software for `rendering fragmented and unharmonised/unprocessed data usable`
2. Implement `data-sharing cooperation` to make hidden and restricted data accessible 
3. Develop `new survey methods` for capturing scarce data.

These methodological innnovation build on the previous collaboration among many of the OpenMusE Consortium partners. For examples, see the [Publications](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#featured) section of the `Digital Music Observatory` page.

## BRIDGE data gaps with open data that anybody can use {#BRIDGE}

*“Promote standardised data collection about the music (sub-)sector(s) to measure the contribution of the EU music sector to the whole economy”*
1. Define and demonstrate best practices on `harmonisation of public data` (e.g., Eurostat)
2. Define and demonstrate best practices on `harmonisation of proprietary data` (e.g., CMO data)
3. Create and run `standardised enterprise surveys` suitable for music MSMEs, that capture the contribution of numerous small players to the economy
4. Enable and promote `collection of streaming service data` using novel sampling strategies.

See [data we can offer](#data-we-can-offer) below.

*“Provide an estimation of the impact of music participation to the society”*
1. Create and run `standardised Cultural Access and Participation surveys`
2. Create and run `valuation models that incorporate zero-price music use` (e.g., home copying, piracy)
3. Create and run `valuation models` that synthesise `economic and non-economic societal values` of music participation
4. `Report and visualise` music valuation `data` and `models` in an automated, continually-updated `online dashboard`.

## EMPOWER stakeholders and policymakers to take data-driven actions {#EMPOWER}

“Increase the transparency of the music industry, in particular the online/streaming business”	
1. Publish open-source software and econometric models for streaming music data valuation (demonstrated for at least one major provider and transferable to others)
2. Build awareness of industry conditions through regular face-to-face and online dissemination, communication, and exploitation activities

*“Provide policymakers with effective tools for measuring and enhancing the impact of EU policy making”*	
1. Develop an open-source online dashboard that continually aggregates and reports disparate music data, with “plug-and-play” functionality vis-a-vis national databases
2. Implement transferable pilot projects on music valuation (BG/HU), diversity (SK), social and environmental sustainability (IT), and technical innovation (DE)
3. Release policy reports and recommendations on Music Economy; Music Diversity and Circulation; Music, Society, and Citizenship; and Music Technology.

Our results will be published in the Open Music Observatory, which will follow the specificaiton of the [Feasibility Study on the Establishment of the European Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/).

## Data that we can offer {#data-we-can-offer}
By providing continually updated data on five industry pillars – innovation, music and society, music economy, music diversity and circulation, and music policy – we will accurately capture the economic and social value created by the sector, as well as providing stakeholders with data-driven means of maximizing this value.
- [x] **For copyright and neighbouring rights-holders and their organizations**: Value of music, euro value of the value gap, private copying, privacy---we have data and make estimates with all known music value estimation techniques.
- [x]	**For live music organizations**: Pan-European audience surveys; demographic comparisons of all European audiences; attendance predictions, attendance profiling.
- [x] **For granting authorities**: we have the world's largest survey-based dataset on how musicians work and live; we create ex ante needs assessment and grants evaluation indicators and ex-post grant evaluation indicators.
- [x] **For labels and music publishers**: we make big data understandable; we create price and volume indexes of streaming markets; we tell you about price developments and selection probabilities in different cities and countries; we understand the biases of the Spotify and YouTube algorithms; and we measure (meta)data problems and offer scalable solutions.
- [x] **For music export offices**: we measure domestic and foreign market shares in streaming; we create actionable key performance indicators; and we do geographical targeting.

- [Artisjus](https://www.artisjus.hu/) (HU), the representative organization of Hungarian composers and lyricists, and the initiator of the [CEEMID](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/usecase/ceemid/) project, together with SOZA, will assist Musicautor to re-valuate the use of music in Bulgaria in a way that can be scaled to any European country, and try to improve probably the poorest markets revenues similarly to the good results of the former CEEMID in Hungary and Slovakia. 
- [Musicautor](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/musicautor-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80/) (BG), the representative sister organization of Bulgarian rightsholders,  will validate the valuation methodologies of our projects with putting them in use, trying to replicate the double-digit growth from Hungary and Slovakia.

Our observatory follows the agile open collaboration method from open-source software development, and it has a triangular approach.  We believe that data which is created by peer-reviewed, open algorithms, and thus open for review from the business, policy and scientific community is the best addition to your business proprietary data.  By sharing data with us, we can build world-class KPIs that give you a competitive edge in the data-driven music industry.

For labels and music publishers: we make big data understandable; we create price and volume indexes of streaming markets; we tell you about price developments and selection probabilities in different cities and countries; we understand the biases of the Spotify and YouTube algorithms; and we measure (meta)data problems and offer scalable solutions.

## Data Coverage {#data-coverage}

Our research project contributes to all of the expected outcomes of the
call. Our ambition is to develop an open science and open data service
which complements the existing statistical service of Eurostat. In
partnership with key music industry and policy partners, we are going to
fill approximately 41 data gaps within the policy context of *Music
Moves Europe*, as identified by the *Feasibility Study for a European
Music Observatory*, with about 120 high-value indicators. We will
**develop key performance indicators** for music businesses and **policy
indicators** to “better detect the performance of the European music
sector and its contribution to economic and social development, as well
as to sustainability.”

We believe that existing data availability is better than that described
in the *Feasibility study*. As stated in this final report, the 2019
Open Data Directive further extended the availability of re-usable
public sector information (PSI) with open science data. In PSI, open
government data, and open science data, there is a huge potential to
fill in the data gaps without new data collection—the fact that data can
be reused instead of being recollected is the main aim of the directive.
These open data sources are legally open but are not accessible without
further investment; our Consortium wants to make this investment, and
produce about 50% of all the data needs of the future European Music
Observatory.

The [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/),
which was called [CEEMID](https://reprex.nl/project/ceemid/) at the time
of the creation of the *Feasiblity Study*, has 7 years of experience in
filling in data gaps with open data. It has created metadata maps to
more than 1000 indicators, covering almost all of the data gaps in the
*Feasiblity Study*. We know where to locate data, and now we have to
invest in processing, validating, documenting, and making it available
for the European music sector.

## Pillar 1: Music Economy

In the case of `Pillar 1 – Music & Economy`, we are usually able to
locate the source of the data, and we have some experience in processing
the data and bringing it to light. We have mapped many perceived data
gaps to the various data harmonization projects of GESAC and CISAC, and
we will seek cooperation with these organizations and their members to
find a secure and voluntary way to retrieve the data.

In other cases, we will rely on on the 2019/1024/EU [Open Data
Directive]((https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019L1024))
to access, process, document, and disseminate the data.

The only data gap that we do not intent do address is the “impact of the
non-profit sector”.

## Pillar 2: Music Circulation & Diversity

We will address the music circulation problems with our WP big data.
Together with our leading statistical experts, data scientists, and
reproducible research experts we will create sampling techniques that
allow to make representative indicators from streaming data. Streaming
data is largely accessible, but not in a representative manner. Using
advanced statistical methodologies like inverse reverse sampling—which
is often used in quantitative finance to analyze large problems—we will
create representative data following our pioneering work made in the
Central European Music Industry Report and later the Digital Music
Creators’ Project initiated by the UK Intellectual Property Office.

## Pillar 4: Music & Innovation

1.  We will connect to several innovation topics in music by providing
    research, data, and evidence. Building on the work of the
    [Blockchain & Society](https://www.ivir.nl/projects/blockchain-society/) research
    project of our Consortium member, the Institute for Information Law
    [IViR](https://www.ivir.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, we will
    address issues related to NFT and blockchain technologies in music.

2.  Connecting to the work of various music stakeholders in Finland, we
    will experiment with the safe data sharing of confidential data,
    avoiding the extreme pitfalls of ‘radical openness’ and ‘closed
    data’. With the University of Bologna, and eight years of experience
    in sensitive data sharing with the [Digital Music
    Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) (formerly:
    [CEEMID](https://reprex.nl/project/ceemid/)), we will create various
    statistical methods to create anonymized and synthetic datasets that
    do not endanger business or private data.

3.  We are going to design indicators and carry out a landscape mapping
    with [Music Tech Europe](https://www.musictecheuropeacademy.eu/), a
    new organization that aims to become the representative of music
    startups and music ecosystems in the European Union.
