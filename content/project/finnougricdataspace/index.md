We would like to present the concept and a demo of a *Finno-Ugric Data
Sharing Space* as a knowledge base and a trustworthy AI
application, and a replication of our *Slovak Comprehensive Music
Database*[^1] created with a data sharing space in 2020-2024 . Our
application follows the novel AI and data regulatory requirements and
recommendations[^2], particularly human-in-control and human-in-the-loop
procedures, with a particular emphasis on community stewardship and
control.

{{% callout note %}}
We started experimenting with the legal, organisational, semantic and technical 
challenges of creating a genuinely trustworthy, AI-supported data-sharing space that 
can find and connect tangible and intangible elements of the Finno-Ugric cultural 
universes. We were also seeking a better governance model for oversight for the 
custodians of these endangered, shrinking universes in their language and with 
little technical knowledge, partly as alternatives to the established Wikipedia 
to the open knowledge incubation method for small linguistic minorities.

## What are the competencies of the system that we are building?

`Q1` **Which recordings of contemporary musical work and traditional music were 
released in the Liv and Samoyedic languages in 2012?**

A data (sharing) space is a system that integrates data whenever needed or permitted. 
The Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange, European Open Science Cloud, Europeana, 
the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) will be connected with 
private systems like Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, the Spotify or YouTube API. 
Semantic interoperability means that our system understands public and private 
cultural APIs.

`Q2` **How can we find new knowledge about the historical or contemporary Khanti-Manysi music tradition?**

The organisational interoperability is necessary to create systems that can support application from diverse collections and organisations. We must understand that archivists, rights managers, librarians, museologists, NGOs, private collectors, festival organisers often work with the same data but in a different job or workflow. We do not only need to understand which things belong to the Khanti-Manysi universe, but also how a librarian or a streaming service would handle that part of the cultural universe.

`Q3` **Which songs refer to dreams in their title or lyrics, regardless of language?**

Starting with a playlist dataset of songs on Spotify, we enrich it with metadata in a way that we can serve first language-independent, then language-specific inferences and queries. In our conference presentation we will explain this by helping a curator who in our 14 language playlist wants to find songs about „imagining events while sleeping” or about a „dream”. (Check out our [dreams playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6KxCdrO9iqSTQnr8KHHmtr) on Spotify.)

`Q4` **What should be the linguistically correct description of a curated list of Samoyedic musical pieces in the Liv language?**

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/media/slides/dnbh2025/20250306_D_Antal_Tartu_generating_descriptions.png" caption="" numbered="false" >}}</td>

Our system generates semantic statements from trustworthy metadata. The semantic statements are then translated to natural language descriptions. We aim for a level of fluency that is suitable for users within the Finno-Ugric communities. This tool can improve the curation and governance of open knowledge projects that cannot recruit many reviewers with a high level of language competency to give an effective oversight for a knowledge base or an AI application.

## Background

Our work in Slovakia aims to prototype work for a future European Music
Observatory [^3]. It is a significant extension of the similar work of a
best practice presented on DHNB 2023[^4]. We extend the legal,
organisational and semantic interoperability towards privately owned
music streaming platforms, music businesses and NGOs[^5]. For the first
time we connected a national copyright registry (Slovak Performing and
Mechanical Rights Society) parallel to the authority control of a
national library. We included the Wikimedia Slovensko, a custodian of
the community-edited Slovak Wikipedia to our data sharing institutions.
Our approach is a significant step forward, because in the music,
audiovisual, or fashion domains the private sector owns more data and
digital assets than the GLAM sector.

Our work is based on a mature, long-term data science research program;
the creation of scientifically reviewed open-source software libraries,
and their applications in the cross-section of social sciences and
digital humanities research. We want to show that we can break down data
silo barriers among different institutions’ data as well as with our
conceptualisation, replication and federation practices, barriers to new
geographical coverage areas, further scientific disciplines, and the
tacit knowledge of smaller subcultural and minority communities.

We would like to present a small scale dataspace as an interoperable,
interdisciplinary, and area-relevant explicit knowledge base and
trustworthy AI that poster viewers can try out. To show the versatility
of our cross-domain conceptualisation, we will connect songs about
“Dreams” with potential locations, performances, choreographies and
festive dress from various ethnic groups of the Baltics area.

Our novel research has already made inroads into this area:

-   In our work within *Collecting, Evaluating, and Connecting Data for
    Dress History* [6], we added information on tangible, music-relevant
    heritage connected to the music; we are also experimenting with the
    conceptualisation and extension to the intangible heritage aspect of
    folk dance choreography.

-   We want to show that our mature knowledge base concerning Slovak
    music can be federated with area-specific ethnomusicological
    knowledge from the Archives of Latvian Folklore, and through the recent
    community curated collections on the living music tradition of
    Finno-Ugric minorities.

-   We are committed to ensuring that our data sharing space is not only
    accessible in Estonian, Latvian, Hungarian, and English, but also to
    some extent in Livonian, and other minority languages.

-   Following on the bad example of the Livonian and Mari Wikipedia
    incubators, we want to show how the open knowledge technology of
    Wikibase (the software behind Wikipedia, Wikidata and other open
    knowledge projects) can be used in a better way with higher data
    governance and community stewardship.
