We would like to present the concept and a demo of a *Finno-Ugric Data
Sharing Space* as a knowledge base and a trustworthy AI
application, and a replication of our *Slovak Comprehensive Music
Database*[1] created with a data sharing space in 2020-2024 . Our
application follows the novel AI and data regulatory requirements and
recommendations [2], particularly human-in-control and human-in-the-loop
procedures, with a particular emphasis on community stewardship and
control.

Our work in Slovakia aims to prototype work for a future European Music
Observatory [3]. It is a significant extension of the similar work of a
best practice presented on DHNB 2023[4]. We extend the legal,
organisational and semantic interoperability towards privately owned
music streaming platforms, music businesses and NGOs[5]. For the first
time we connected a national copyright registry (Slovak Performing and
Mechanical Rights Society) parallel to the authority control of a
national library. We included the Wikimedia Slovensko, a custodian of
the community-edited Slovak Wikipedia to our data sharing institutions.
Our approach is a significant step forward, because in the music,
audiovisual, or fashion domains the private sector owns more data and
digital assets than the GLAM sector.

Our work is based on a mature, long-term data science research program;
the creation of scientifically reviewed open-source software libraries,
and their applications in the cross-section of social sciences and
digital humanities research. We want to show that we can break down data
silo barriers among different institutions’ data as well as with our
conceptualisation, replication and federation practices, barriers to new
geographical coverage areas, further scientific disciplines, and the
tacit knowledge of smaller subcultural and minority communities.

We would like to present a small scale dataspace as an interoperable,
interdisciplinary, and area-relevant explicit knowledge base and
trustworthy AI that poster viewers can try out. To show the versatility
of our cross-domain conceptualisation, we will connect songs about
“Dreams” with potential locations, performances, choreographies and
festive dress from various ethnic groups of the Baltics area.

Our novel research has already made inroads into this area:

-   In our work within *Collecting, Evaluating, and Connecting Data for
    Dress History* [6], we added information on tangible, music-relevant
    heritage connected to the music; we are also experimenting with the
    conceptualisation and extension to the intangible heritage aspect of
    folk dance choreography.

-   We want to show that our mature knowledge base concerning Slovak
    music can be federated with area-specific ethnomusicological
    knowledge from the Latvian Folk Archive, and through the recent
    community curated collections on the living music tradition of
    Finno-Ugric minorities.

-   We are committed to ensuring that our data sharing space is not only
    accessible in Estonian, Latvian, Hungarian, and English, but also to
    some extent in Livonian, and other minority languages.

-   Following on the bad example of the Livonian and Mari Wikipedia
    incubators, we want to show how the open knowledge technology of
    Wikibase (the software behind Wikipedia, Wikidata and other open
    knowledge projects) can be used in a better way with higher data
    governance and community stewardship.
