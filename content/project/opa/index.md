Our ambition is to truly maximize transparency, (re)usability, scientific, policy, and business impact while embracing the best practices laid out in the the recommendations of the *Reproducibility of scientific results scoping report*, and the *Progress on Open Science: Towards a Shared Research Knowledge System* policy documents of the European Commission's DG Research & Innovation, as well as the best practices outlined  in the evidence-based *Knowledge4Policy* [K4P](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/home_en) platform of the European Commission. 

For the first time in Europe, we will apply and contextualize the [Open Policy Analysis Guidelines](http://www.bitss.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/OPA-Guidelines.pdf) (OPA Guidelines) in our [OpenMuse](/projects/openmuse) project.  

The `Open Policy Analysis Guidelines` grew out of several initiatives in research transparency with the aim of maximizing benefits in the context of the [Foundations for Evidence-based Policy Making Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174) initiative in the United States. We want to ensure that by relying not only on the best European practices, but considering trans-Atlantic experiences, we will make the most out of the opportunities offered by the European [Open Data Directive of 2019]((https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32019L1024)). This will not only mean rendering a dramatically increased data availability for our partners, as well as increased quality assurance and transparency in our work, but also immediate data access. 

Our new software will continue to run in the cloud, depositing all of our findings---*Findable*, *Accessible*, *Interoperable* and *Reuseable* digital assets, including our well-designed and user-tested indicators in 41 data gap fields---into our [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), which already hosts a [modern REST API](https://api.music.dataobservatory.eu/) similar to the Eurostat Rest API.

standardized codebooks.
