**Reprex’s data observatories are modern, 21st-century re-imagination of the observatory concept.  In the 18-19th century, observatories were the centers of structured observation and data collection about the natural world.  Since the 20th century, the EU and UN organizations created or acknowledged about 80 observatories ranging from natural sciences to social sciences and data observatories.**

## Mission statement

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/slides/slider/big_data_creates_inequalities_centered.webp" caption="Currently, almost unregulated machine learning is taking over newer and newer roles in human creation, jobs, tasks, and groups with the historically low quantity or quality of data representation are facing a new digital divide. (➡️  [project page](https://reprex.nl/project/crea-innovlab-2023/), [slides](https://reprex.nl/slides/crea-innovlab-2023/).)" numbered="false" >}}</td>

Our observatories aim to help small businesses, NGOs, foundations, research groups, and universities that do not have a data engineering team and cannot finance large, proprietary data collection and processing programs in social sciences and digital humanities. We help them to access big data, poolin their research needs, and provide open-source access to research automation. 

{{< spoiler text="Data feminism: fighting the gender bias of AI is a blueprint to correct other forms of injustice" >}}
- Human- and machine-readable information about women is less quantity than men: the algorithm can find less suitable audiences for female writers and composers or suggests services or content to female readers. 
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Cultural and linguistic diversity: AI should not only benefit English-speaking countries and individuals" >}}
- As books, films, and music is increasingly sold by algorithms on global platforms, inventories and catalogs that are not perfectly machine-readable or not available in English are sidelined by the autonomous recommender or sales systems. 
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Competitiveness of SMEs, NGOs, small countries, small research groups" >}}
- Market, policy or scientific researchers who have no reliable access to big data assets and research automation become cannot compete with organizations that employ an army of data engineers, data scientists in research,  innovation, or business development.

The observatories are open collaboration projects, following the principles of open-source software development, open science, linking open data, and the Open Policy Analysis Guidelines. 
The observatory partners collaborate on various projects that are either self-funded or granted. They jointly create datasets and databases, online collections of digital objects and knowledge, and open-source software.

## Governance & Budget {#funding-governance}


The observatories do have not a permanent budget, they are currently financed by Reprex and various user projects.  Reprex will release a first business plan in June 2023 that contains a long-term public-private partnership plan based on financial, environmental, and social sustainability, and an ethical, inclusive, and open governance plan.

{{< spoiler text="Read more on budgetary and goverance principles" >}}

 - [The Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/) is an important source of inspiration for our plans. We will evaluate the suitability of this model, bearing in mind that our observatories will not only serve scholarly (educational and research) but commercial purposes, too.
 - [Open Data Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&uri=CELEX:32019L1024) is an important piece of EU legislation. Our observatories were designed to optimalize this legal instrument for in public benefit and for-profit use cases, too.
 - [Data Governance Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act-explained) is a new EU law that aims to make more data available by regulating the re-use of publicly/held, protected data, by boosting data sharing through the regulation of novel data intermediaries and by encouraging the sharing of data for altruistic purposes. It enters into force in September 2023.
 - [Open Music Europe](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/openmuse/) is an EU-funded project that aims to bring the [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/) from a prototype to an EU-recognized, official European Music Observatory. We will experiment with a governance model that follows the EU's helix-model to serve as a basis of further observatories.

## Observatories 
<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/slides/observatories/our_observatory_ecosystems.webp" caption="" numbered="false" >}}</td>

Please join one of our observatories:

- [ ] [Digital Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/): This is a maturing project with an increasing number of open and private data assets, users, stakeholders, aiming for an official EU recognition by 2025.
- [ ] [Cultural Creative Sectors Industries Observatory](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/): Our third observatory is currently seeking early collaborators and funded projects to further develop the idea and release a large enough number of data assets with use cases and publications. We want to create a momentum in 2023.
- [ ] [Green Deal Data Observatory](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/): Our second observatory is in an early stage, but the recent adoption of the CSRD Directive and the need for reliable environmental sustainability data will provide us with excellent growth opportunities.
- [ ] [Social Sustainability Data Observatory](): this project is in early concept phase.
- [ ] [Competition Data Observatory](): this project is in early concept phase.
- [ ] [Open Collections Net](): This project is in it inception phase, but it builds on many years of work with music-related collections.
