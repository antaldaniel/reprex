The data cube model in itself is is originated in the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange, and it is almost fully harmonzied with the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the standard model for data interchange on the web.

## Interoperable, FAIR datasets

The primary aim of dataset is create well-referenced, well-described,
interoperable datasets from data.frames, tibbles or data.tables that
translate well into the W3C DataSet definition within the [Data Cube
Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/) in a reproducible
manner. The data cube model in itself is is originated in the
[Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange](https://sdmx.org/), and it is
almost fully harmonzied with the Resource Description Framework (RDF),
the standard model for data interchange on the web[^1].

A mapping of R objects into these models has numerous advantages:

1.  Makes data importing easier and less error-prone;
2.  Leaves plenty of room for documentation automation, resulting in far
    better reusability and reproducability;
3.  The publication of results from R following the
    [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles is far
    easier, making the work of the R user more findable, more
    accessible, more interoperable and more reusable by other users;
4.  Makes the placement into relational databases, semantic web
    applications, archives, repositories possible without time-consuming
    and costly data wrangling (See [From dataset To
    RDF](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/RDF.html)).

Our package functions work with any structured R objects (data.fame,
data.table, tibble, or well-structured lists like json), however, the
best functionality is achieved by the (See [The dataset S3
Class](https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/dataset.html)), which
is inherited from `data.frame()`.
