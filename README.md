# Welcome to the Reprex Website 👋

🙋‍♀️ Creating an ecosystem of open data and open knowledge sharing in R, hugo, and open science repositories.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - you must abide by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) Code of Conduct.

This is the repository of the website of [Reprex](https://reprex.nl/), a Netherlands-based reproducible research startup.  We created this website, along with many others, using an open source Hugo template. And we create many [open-source software solutions](https://reprex.nl/software/) ourselves.

Our work relies on commissioned work, grants, sponsorship, and the same goes to our friends at Wowchemy.  When you use our free products, please give us proper attribution, and if you can, contribute with work or money to keep our products going. 

## [Hugo Academic Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic)

The Reprex website is built with the Hugo **Academic Resumé Template** empowers you to easily create your job-winning online resumé, showcase your academic publications, and create online courses or knowledge bases to grow your audience.

️**Trusted by 250,000+ researchers, educators, and students.** Highly customizable via the integrated **no-code, widget-based Wowchemy page builder**, making every site truly personalized ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## We ask you, humbly, to support this open source movement

Reprex builds open source products, and our friends at Wowchemy do so, too.  You can use Reprex's website, or our observatory websites as a template based on their work.  But we have both worked a lot with it, and therefore, if you use the Wowchemy template, we would like to emphasises the request of the Wowchemy team:

Today we ask you to defend the open source independence of the Wowchemy website builder and themes 🐧

We're an open source movement that depends on your support to stay online and thriving, but 99.9% of our creators don't give; they simply look the other way.
